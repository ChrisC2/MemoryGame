### Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, ReactJS, ES6
#### Description: 
This was my first dive into ES6 & ReactJS. It is an implementation of a memory game in which a user attempts to find all the matching tiles in the set. Included are three difficulty modes, 3D flip animations, score keeping, and responsive styling based on difficulty settings.

## Run the App:
